# Economic and Employment Factors Affecting Suicide Rates (2018-2021)

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between economic factors, employment rates, and suicide rates across different countries from 2018 to 2021. The study aims to understand how these variables interact and influence mental health outcomes.


## Research Focus
- **Research Questions**:
  1. Is there a relationship between GDP and suicide rates?
  2. Is there a relationship between employment rates and suicide rates?
  3. Is there a relationship between religious context and suicide rates?

## Methodology
- **Sampling Method**: Convenience sampling
- **Data Sources**: Various countries' data from 2018-2021, focusing on GDP, employment rates, and suicide rates

## Findings
- A slight positive correlation between GDP per capita and suicide rates
- A very weak correlation between employment rates and suicide rates
- Varied suicide rates among different religious groups

## Conclusion
Economic factors alone do not fully explain variations in suicide rates. Comprehensive suicide prevention policies should consider economic, social, and cultural factors.

## Potential Issues
- Selection bias due to incomplete representation of countries
- Variability in how countries report data
- Influence of confounding variables not controlled in the analysis
